# Tempest Website

A Next.js + Tailwind implementation based on your Figma homepage thumbnail.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Colors/typography match the current design direction; we can tighten spacing and exact sizes if you export the desktop frame as PNGs (or share a public Figma link with inspectable layers).
